# QuizReborn
A simple Harry Potter quiz game which keeps a track of answers submitted by users and updates game score automatically at the end of each question.

It uses Linear Layout as Parent layer which is gonna be soon replaced with Constraint Layout in the next commit. Tracking of user seleced answers are managed by setOnClickListener(). It contains a seperate .java file (Questions.java) for initializing and managing setter-getter properties.

The result of each question is shown as custom Toast message when the users clicks on the button to answer the question.
